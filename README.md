# Guessing Game

This is a number guessing game written in python which consists of three modes; easy,medium and hard. Each mode contains there own difficulty in time and amount of guesses.If you're confused and you'd like a small hint,type hint in the python user input and you shall be granted  an easy/hard hint depending on your mode.

# Requirements

**1)** Install [python](https://www.python.org) 

**1.5)** Install  [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

**2)** Install colorama
If you are confused on installing colorama,run the following:
```
pip install colorama
```

# Modes

### Hard Mode
Hard mode picks a number in the range of 100 to 500.You are only limited to one hint and have 5 guesses so I'd use them wiseley.Hard mode may seem "impossible" hence the name "Hard Mode".I'd recommend starting with Easy Mode but if you want to test your luck then I'd give this mode a shot.


### Medium Mode 

Medium mode picks a number in the range of 50 to 100 and unlike hard mode,you have 5 hints and have an unlimited amount of guesses.One way of playing this mode is number spamming though that's pretty boring and totally defeats the purpose of the game.


### Easy Mode

Easy mode picks a number in the range of 1 to 15 and like medium mode,you have 5 hints and have an unlimited amount of guesses. This mode is pretty easy(self explanatory) so if you want something more challenging I'd suggest going for medium mode or hard mode


### Mode Values

**1 = Easy**

**2 = Medium**

**3 = Hard**

The default value is easy if you dont input anything
